* In this project, I'm developing an online hotel room booking facility for vacations.
* Here, visitors can sign in via google and book any room they want by providing necessary information.
* While signed in, a user can manage all orders and add new room. This is because there is no admin panel in this project.
* For user authentication I'm using Firebase.
* And I've used React.js, React bootstrap, React router, Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB.
